## Using-Machine-Learning-Models-to-Predict-S-P500-Price-Level-and-Spread-Direction
This project was done as part of an internship with Technocolabs Pvt. Ltd in Sept, 2021.
## Intro
This project aims on predicting the future price changes of a stock of a company.
This uses the previous prices and financial news related to that particular
company. The data required is provided by Technocolabs Pvt. Ltd. The datasets used cover the
S&P daily closing price from 1986 to 2018, and historical stock prices from the last
5 years (including the daily open, high, close, and volume) for all companies found
on the S&P 500 index as of February 2018. The datasets used contain data
related to stock price, opening, closing values and the highest, lowest price that
particular stock reached.
### Goal
To make S& P500 stock investment more accessible to investors and gain more long term profits.
### Technique
Various ML & DL models were implemented for S&P500 data which can predict the price level and developed polished visualizations to share results of data analyses through 
Stream-lit using LSTM model which has the highest accuracy 90 - 96.4%.
